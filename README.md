# Sushi Go

This is a hobby project that is currently a work in progress.

Sushi Go is a board game developed by GameWright. I am in the process of developing a website where you can play the game (for the diehard fans out there, this is technically an implementation of Sushi Go Party) against computers. I am using RedwoodJS as a full-stack framework. At this stage the game logic is implemented and users can sign up and login. The next steps currently are to implement the achievements, leaderboard, and some of the static pages (home, instructions, etc.). Finally, I will implement forgot password functionality and make preparations for deployment.

Additional features include/will include...
- User accounts, login, signup, forgot password
- Leaderboards for high scores, fastest completion, etc.
- A list of 25 achievements for users to complete (with a suprise for 100% completion)

What I am Improving?
- General coding skills through implementing logic of the game itself
- Web development and integration with a database leveraging RedwoodJS
- Maintaining a large codebase by leaving comments to help future me

Here are three consecutive screenshots of a user logged in as "Joey" playing the game.
