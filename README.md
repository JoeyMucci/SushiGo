# Sushi Go

Sushi Go is a board game developed by GameWright. I have developed a website where you can play the game (for the diehard fans out there, this is technically an implementation of Sushi Go Party) against computers. I am using RedwoodJS as a full-stack framework. 

Additional features include...
- User accounts, login, signup, forgot password
- Leaderboards for high scores, fastest completion, etc.
- A list of 25 achievements for users to complete (with a suprise for 100% completion)

What Skills did I Improve?
- General coding skills through implementing logic of the game itself
- Web development and integration with a database leveraging RedwoodJS
- Maintaining a large codebase by leaving comments to help future me

Please start your journey as Sushi Squire and move your way up the leaderboard!
